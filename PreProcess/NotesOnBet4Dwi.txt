## This is a footnote on the brain extraction step when dealing with dMRI ##

As a start, if you have an anatomical image, you should immediately use the 
FSL BET2 command, since DIPY's median_otsu function is completely useless.

When dealing with diffusion data, the choice can be more complicated. Ultimately,
what determines the use of some utility is it's result so you might want to 
try both approaches and then choose whichever is better. However, from 
personal experience I can tell you that if you have high b-value data the
median_otsu will struggle. This is possibly because the decay in the intensity
of the signal causes median_otsu to treat brain tissue as sorroundings. This 
translates to a very smooth brain mask which although similar to the real 
misses brain tissue. In the worst scenario, median_otsu introduces wholes 
inside the brain when cutting to much of the brain stem. If this happens,
consider switching to FSL BET2 to eextract a binary mask and then apply that 
mask with fslmaths -mas to all the volumes of the original image. Of course you 
woud need to find the appropiate values for the parameters.

Alternatively, median_otsu has been proven to work very well for low b-value
data (e.g., b=1000) apprximately keeping all the brain tissue without even 
smoothing the resulting mask. As a final note on the median_otsu parameters,
since they are not really explained in the DIPY Docs, it has three parameters:
numpass, mediaradius and dilate. The higher these values, the less aggressive 
is the mask. However please note that even if the masking is not aggressive, 
all the problems mentioned here could (and most probably will) still prevail.
