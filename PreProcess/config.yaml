## Use eddy_cuda: Be sure that your os supports it. 
#    Type the command find $FSLDIR -name '*eddy_cuda*' to verfiy what FSL supports. Then nvidia-smi to verify that your GPU supports it. 
#    You can also refer to https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/eddy/UsersGuide otherwise and/or https://www.nemotos.net/?p=3701
